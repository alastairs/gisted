GistEd
======

GistEd is a simple editor for [Gists](http://gist.github.com/).  You will be able to manipulate Gists directly using the editor, including adding files, viewing Gist content, etc.  It will support Markdown parsing and hopefully syntax highlighting for common languages.  Please log feature requests (and, eventually, bugs) in GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/alastairs/gisted/issues).  I'm working with WPF and the .NET stack.  

Prod me on Twitter ([@alastairs](http://www.twitter.com/alastairs)) if I'm getting behind or if you'd like to contribute!
